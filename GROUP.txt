GROUP MEMBERS: Mitchell Hebert and Derek Anton

WORK DIVISION: A lot of work was done in pair programming so dividing work on paper

NOTE: Since there was a natural dividing line between logic for adding and removing 
items to buffer and the setup and creation of threads, most of the work was divided 
along that line. However, we did all work when together so we were able to talk through
all logic together.
