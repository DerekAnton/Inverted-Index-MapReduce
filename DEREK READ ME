OK so status:

It works for 2 files and one reduce thread. If there are more than one reduce threads it hangs and I think it is dead locked.
That seems to be the last issue. I havent tested it on the txt files from moodle either.

I am no longer using BoundedBuffer.java. It has been replaced by BBMonitor.java. It is cleaner and 
it uses new tech I wasn't aware of before. 

Data is also passed using WordData.java which makes things cleaner. 

its really late so I dont know what elese to put. 

if you have any questions let me know
